        "Airbnb founders Joe Gebbia, Brian Chesky, and Nathan Blecharczyk developed the business in 2008. Initially, Gebbia and Chesky started off using their own place as a bed-and-breakfast to make a few extra bucks to pay rent. Airbnb does not own properties. It acts as an **intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent.** Creating an account on Airbnb is free, and it is relatively simple. Airbnb has listings all over the map, from Savannah, Georgia, to Honolulu, Hawaii, to international listings. The service currently has more than **5.6 million listings in roughly 220 countries around the world.**\n",
